Tutoring:
---
HKN offers free one-on-one peer tutoring. Simply contact a tutor to arrange a time. The tutorâ€™s netid, and the courses for which they are offering tutoring are listed below. If you would like a tutor for a course that is not listed below, please reach out to Molly Fane at mkfane2[at]illinois.edu, and we will be happy to arrange something. You can also check the [CARE website](http://publish.illinois.edu/engineering-care/) for tutoring and extra office hours in non-ECE required classes.

After the session, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NMAgB1nKT2S_UE7yKy4KB6PNFr4cqnBuRoIP3wegFes/viewform). We appreciate your feedback.

Technical Interviews:
---
HKN offers mock technical interviews targeted for students interviewing with ECE companies (software and hardware). Interviews are available either in an interview room with a whiteboard, or over the phone. You will be given questions that accurately reflect the questions given by the company you will be interviewing with, and, where possible, your interviewer will have received an offer from the company as well.
